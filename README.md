# Case Study: Appointment Scheduling System  

## **Overview**  
This repository presents the case study documents I developed to design a comprehensive Appointment Scheduling System for a healthcare platform. The documents demonstrate a structured approach to addressing user needs and translating them into actionable requirements and designs.

## **Contents**  
The repository includes:  
- **User Stories**: Problem-centric user stories for both patient and provider sides, highlighting key challenges and proposed solutions.  
- **Functional and Non-Functional Requirements**: Detailed specifications defining the system's capabilities and constraints.  
- **Success Metrics**: Goals and measurable outcomes for evaluating the system's effectiveness.  
- **Figma Prototype**: A clickable prototype illustrating the proposed solution (link inside the documents).  
- **Rough Sketches**: Initial conceptual diagrams created to visualize the solution.  

## **What You'll Find**  
These documents showcase the following:  
1. **Comprehensive Approach**: Identifying user pain points and proposing effective solutions.  
2. **Clear Documentation**: Well-structured and actionable product requirements.  
3. **User-Centric Design**: Prototypes and sketches tailored to address user needs effectively.  

## **Attachments**  
I have included the rough sketches that offer insights into my thought process and design considerations. Please feel free to review them for a better understanding of the solution approach.
